6.3.13 - Started with restoring src directory to the backup when nstorage = bstorage/c2n. The model runs without any problems from 11/15/02 -  1/03/03.
6.4.13  
RUN: 
Checked model run again. 
-Nstorage starts out as 0 for all cohorts on day 1 
-Forest N is conserved

BSTORAGE/C2N STORAGE .NE. NSTORAGE - problem 

 

HOWEVER nstorage .ne. bstorage/c2n when new recruits are created. This happens at the end of the month, in the reproduction file (after  call deallocate_patchtype(cpatch) /line 261). when I print a statement telling the program to stop if nstoarge and bstorage/c2n are not equal, I get a segmentation fault.. without the print statement the file runs ok but stops again because they are not equal

If I print a statment saying it entered the deallocation subroutine, I also get a segmentation fault

This was a problem before my leave. It is not related to the dynamics that I worked on. It is related to the initial setup of nstorage. 



Met with David, looking into why model crashes with nstorage and
bstorage/c2n.

1) go to branch Nstorage
2) build/bin  make clean
3)/scpc:tiger:/home/jhlevy/ED2/ED.santarem/build/bin/include.mk.tiger.. change line in make file to run slower but identify the problem..
4) compile and run model..Error message : 
NEW RECRUIT
forrtl: severe (408): fort: (2): Subscript #1 of the array NSTORAGE has value 17 which is greater than the upper bound of 16

This means that hte program is looking for a 17th value for nstorage
when there could only be 16. Either a 17th value was added to the
array when it shoulddn't have been or the 17th value was left there when it should have been romoved in another process 

5) went into reproduction file, found where NEW RECRUIT
printed.. added a few lines to print 'ico' to see if this was problematic during my if statements, before or after copy recruit
.. ran model again

6) spoke about when to use nstoarge ... 1) reproduction 2) wetn over
fixes n storage.. other then that it maybe it doesnt need to be
used. If defoliation is added to model it can use it to regenerate
leaves.

7) also spoke about when to fill nstorage... when
nstorage<nstorage_max vs nstrage + bleaf/c2n*0.48 < nstorage_max.. we
did not come to a consensus before I left so I am keeping it at
nstorage<nstorage_max for now

BSTORAGE /C2N.NE.NSTORAGE ISSUE
Found 3 problems:
-PHENOLOGU.AUX file has a print statement that causes segementation error,
-repro has print statements that are problematic because not in an icoloop, 
- pn1 uses bstorage but pn2 uses nstroage... may be
the source of the N loss in later dates when Nstoage .ne. bstorage

ONCE these were all fixed, nstorage = bstorage/c2n. Ran model for a year, all looks good. forest n butdget  is closed

6.11.13
WENT BACK TO N_STORAGE_DYNAMICS branch (discussed below) and checked
for these three problems. Problematic print statements in phen_aux and
repro were removed and pn1 and pn2 both use nstorage. Conclusion: this issue did
not carry over to the nstorage_dynamics branch. 

BSTORAGE/C2N STORAGE .NE. NSTORAGE - problem solved
__________________________________________________
NDYNAMICS CHECK-start

TO DO:
Create a second branch that has the nitrogen dynamics that I added before my leave. Run the program without the creation of new cohorts and just test the dynamics that I added. 
2) NEW BRANCH - Nstorage_dynamics..  restored to src4.15 file..
Ran model from 11.15.02 to 1.03.03 and the model ran to completion. No obvious problems.ForestN start  1.072706 /Forest N end: 1.071894. I'm not sure if Forest N is loosing N so I extended the run from 11.15.03 to 1.03.04.. ForestN start  1.072706 /Forest N end: ForestN   1.064569cd ,.. .. the forest N decreases after the monthly calculations..

6.5.13
Run a simple version of the model where there is one cohort and one patch. See if dynamics looks like the expectation.

ED2IN Settings changed:
 
1) from  NL%IED_INIT_MODE = 2  to  NL%IED_INIT_MODE =  0
2) from NL%INCLUDE_THESE_PFT = 1,2,3,4 to NL%INCLUDE_THESE_PFT = 2 
3 )from NL%TREEFALL_DISTURBANCE_RATE  = 0.007 to NL%TREEFALL_DISTURBANCE_RATE =  0

ED_params setting changed:
seedling mortality = 1

Look closely at code in Balive and structural_growth. Runs go to completion

6.6.13
CHECKS:

1) check inputs
Pools (When & How much, Daily, monthly, yearly jumps)
-Nstorage - should fill from resorption and soil as long as <Nstorage_max - YES(10.31.03 Nstorage = max and no N is resorbed. Instead, fsn_in increase by max absorption*nplant)

-Total plant nitrogen uptake, will increase if  Nstorage< Nstorage_max and Nsupply is available after CB is fulfilled, wont exceed supply
- MSN - changes in proportion to total plant nitrogen uptake

Fluxes (When & How much) 
-Resorption -
        max amount is N from leaf and root maintence costs*0.48     - YES
        If resorption N available > max_Nstorage, extra N goes into FSN_in   - YES

-nitrogen_uptake assocaited with MSN for Nstorage - 
CHECK looks good. 12. 01.2002 
         only occurs if Nstorage<Nstorage_max YES
         nitrogen upake increases by the amount of nstorage increase-YES
        Nstorage does not exceed nstorage_max - YES.. althought some rounding errors at E-5 decimal places
N limited scenario (init_nbg soil N = 0)
if nitrogen supply after growth = 0, nstorage does not increase even
if it is wanted to reach nstorage max - YES ( satarting on day 1)
all looks good 2.1.2003

-FSN_in - 
        Min gets 52% of N from leaf and root maintence turnover
        If resorption N available > max_Nstorage, extra N goes into FSN_in - YES

2) outputs
Excess_carbon
CHANGED NBG STARTING SOIL MSN TO 0 in init.nbg file
CHECK ( 9.01 and 9.24.2003):
- Excess should go to 0 and the required N taken from nstorage before the excess C is taken from carbon  balance or added to fsn_in  - YES
- Nstorage should be reduced by n needed for excess c amount if the
pool is large enough - yes

6.12.13

Run the simple version of the model and continue to check for
dynamics..change git commit 62a4edb back to the simple version..pft 2, 

CHECKS: 
fsn_in does not exceed 100% N from leaf and fine root turnover and
does not go below 0.52% of N from leaf and fine root turnover - YES,
added print statements and committed to git

Updated nstorage for subrouine transfer_C_from_storage in growth
balive. commited change. This subroutine does not appear to be
used. If the plant needs C from stoarge  it will use N from storage
also.

Went through rest of code in growth_balive file. everything looks
good. Updated some notes in subroutines and one section in
growth_balive restricting nstorage chagne only when incement <0.   ran model for a year and
forest N = 2.067 at start, at endforest N =2.067 .. looks good
commited to git

CHANGED ED2IN settings to larger run and  ran model for a yr. Forest N
is increasing at daily timesteps.... 


Change disturbance back to 0.007, run model.. forest n still increases
at daily time steps, as expected

Change pft's back to 2, run model.. CRASH, 'I found a cohort with
PFT=3  and it is not in your include_these_pft...'. put back to
1,2,3,4 

Change nbg state to 0 instead of 2, run model, forest N slowly
increasess at last digit, daily interval

Run nbg = 0, include theses pft's, only 2, looks good. 
Running with only 1 pft at at time , forest N is stable  on a daily
basis but when i run with multiple pft's it increases..

CHECKOUT previous versions of model to see when this daily increase
appears.. not in dd24094..


LOGS FROM TODAY ARE MISSING.. I must have done somehting in git..
found 2 errors. 1) endo satement was before call litter.. this is now
fixed
2) nstorage being filled by soil.. used nitrogen_uptake istead of
cpatch%actual_nitrogen_uptake(ico) for calculation
Daily Forest N values are consistent. Monthly values are stable, but
longer runs have a slow increase in forest N.. ex. start

Changed the  alloc_plant_c_balance subroutine. incrment term.. when it
was positive, N was being added to N storage.Forest N is now stable
over day, month, year

NEXT: CHECK DYNAMICS IN STRUCTURAL.GROWTH file...do a run and
visualize N terms with larger forest.. 
 
GROWTH_BALIVE FILE (specific things noted)

1) Nstorage value initialized to 0 on day 1? YES
2) Does Nstorage retain its value from the end of day1 to day 2? YES
3) Does Nstoarge reatin its value from the end of 1 month to the beginning of the next month?  Yes
4) Does Nstoarge reatin its value from the end of 1 year to the beginning of the next year? Yes
5) No N loss associated with respiration.. LOOKS GOOD
6) FSN_IN should not be updated after bstorage respiration calculations, C loss does not mean N loss -  LOOKS GOOD
7) shadow N uptake should be 0 before the shadow calculation - 


Add hydrological n losses 
6.18.13
Met with David. interested in disturbance and so we should add fluxes
that will likely be affected by disturbance.

INPUTS
Ndep = constant .0005kg N/m2/yr - disturbance wount change this input
abitoic N fixation - not sure. look to see if any realtionships are known
BNF - linked by tree death/presence

EXPORTS:
hydrologic N losses - veg cover will alter water budget.. this should
be linked to water ( precip - evaporation - transpiration)
Gas losses - correlated with msn (hedin et al 2003), msn will be linked to veg fsn_in.. temp and moisutre, which will change with disturbance

Added hydrologic losses ( target ForestN after leaching  (1.072706 )
                                                                                         1.072206-1.021706
                                                                                      
                                                                                       

!leaching1 = occurs only when fractw==1 and input>0,..f_leach = .1, no leaching occured because fract never = 1
!leaching2 =  occured anytime input >0,  f_leach = 0.1,forest N fell too fast
!leaching3= occurs when fractw >.90 and input>0,..f_leach = .1. ForestN stayed constant. no leaching because leaching term was too small
!leaching4 = occurs when fractw >.90 and input>0,..f_leach = .5 Same
as above, leaching was not great enough to change ForestN and did not occur very often
!leaching4 = occurs when fractw >.90 and input>0,..f_leach=.9.. Forest N after a  year is 1.072705 .. This is still too small
!leaching5 = occurs when fractw >.85 and input>0,..f_leach=.9.. Forest N after a  year is1.072703  .. .. This is still too small
!leaching6 = occurs when fractw >.80 and input>0,..f_leach=.9.. Forest N after a  year is  1.072703  .. This is still too small

6.19.13
Worked with Xiangtao and anna. changed leaching to look at field capacity vs soil water content.. also msn availability is based on
plants getting priority
 
Leaching 5 : capacity, plants take msn before [N] is calculated,100% leached out , Forest N =     1.072703 (too small)
Leaching 6.  need more water running through, changed water input to
csite%wbudget_precipgain(ipa), ForestN =   1.072699 
Reasoning: evaporation and transpiration will be done at the end of hte day? and will alter the soil water conent so there is no need to
subtract  off these variables at this point in time. Also the time scales of when transpiraiton and evaporation happen are longer then
timescales for when  percolation happens.. and if it rains, there is probably no evaporation right away because of the relative humidity at 
saturation

Leaching 7. soil_water > 0.9*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697 still too small
Leaching 8. soil_water > 0.8*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697 ( i wonder if I compiled this run)
Leaching 9. soil_water > 0.7*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697
Leaching 10. soil_water > 0.6*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697
Leaching 10. soil_water > 0.5*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697
Leaching 10. soil_water > 0.01*field capacity, ForestN =1.072697


6.20.13

CONCLUSION: concentration is too low to make big enough difference.. need to concentrate the soil soilution. Do this by reducing the soil depth from 6 to 1.5 ( where almost all fine roots are found in tropical forest system Jackson 2006)

TARGET: Added hydrologic losses (target ForestN after leaching start: 1.072706 , end: 1.072206-1.021706

Ran a bunch of simulations and then realized tha the water input
calculation was wrong.. divided y sec in day instead of multiplying
. doing new runs


OVERALL: leaching is a little low, but right order of magnitude and within range observed in Hawaii, USE:  0.5 capacity, 2m depth, 0 retained fraction

Noticed that

N storage dynamics: 

Files that contain nstorage dynamics:vegetation_dynamics;structural_growth;reproduction;phenology_driv;phenology_aux;growth_balive;events;disurbance

General structure of nstorage: 
Nstorage inputs - 1) soil and 2) retranslocation from roots and leaves (growth_balive file) . Fills to a max of 1.33 x canopy N
Nstorage outputs - used during disturbance, leafout, and  when MSN < N_uptake(excess C exists).. 
Plant death - all N goes to fast soil N pool or slow soil N pool depending on N in plant structure. N in nstorage goes to fast N pool [disturbance, old age]
New cohorts: initialze Nstorage to 0 - phenology_aux.f90, subroutine subroutine pheninit_balive_bstorage[CURRENTLY PROBLEMATIC]
